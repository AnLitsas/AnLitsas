# 👋 Hey there, I'm Anastasis Litsas!

I'm a Data Scientist and Software Engineer, but that's just my day job. What really gets me going is the endless world of machine learning and deep learning. Currently, I'm wrapping my head around my Master's degree at the University of Crete's Computer Science and Engineering department.

- **Research:** Currently, I'm exploring the applications of deep learning in ultra-fast laser processing. It's as cool as it sounds.
